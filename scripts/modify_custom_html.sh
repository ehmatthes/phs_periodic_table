# This file makes modifications to the html files that are common to every
#  deployment involving static files.
#
# For now this is focused on inserting analytics code, but it will also be about
#  adding headers, footers, and any other custom html desired.
#
# This is meant to work well through a commit-hook, although you can also
#  run the script manually when you want a snapshot of the notebooks in html
#  format.

# To insert Google Analytics code,
#   store it as "intro_programming/ignored_resources/ga_code.txt".
#   Newlines in GA code may throw errors; download or make a one-line version
#   of your GA code.
#
# Insert Google Analytics code just before </head>, if analytics code exists
